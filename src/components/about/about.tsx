            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>During my holiday periods, I spent most of my time behind a computer screen, playing games, playing with corel draw and always had talent for drawing.
                With the amount of time I spent playing games, I began to wonder how these games where created ,the people who created them and their career.
                After researching and having a consultation with my parents, I realized I had the passion, interest and skills to become a software developer.
            </p>
            <p>
                With this, I changed from someone who played games everytime to a dynamic individual with a keen interest in software development.
                Driven by world builders like Elon Musk and Blue Gate , I kept on striving to make the world a better place with my inventions and ideas.
                I am dedicated to improving my skills and knowledge for both personal and soceital growth.
            </p>
            <p>
           In conclusion, I love what i do and am going to keep working hard to achieve my goals and see where my career leads me in the future.
           In hopes to reach greater heights in life and making my country ,Nigeria and the world a better place.
